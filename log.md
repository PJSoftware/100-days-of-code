# Pete's Log: 100 Days Of Code Challenge (Round 1)

## Day 50: May 12, 2020: Tuesday

### Miscellaneous Coding Project: Iteration

**Today's Progress:** Analyse, push new data back into dataset, re-analyse ... rinse, repeat. It took a bit of work to get the iterative process working but I got there.

## Day 49: May 11, 2020: Monday

### Miscellaneous Coding Project: Data Analysis

**Today's Progress:** Performing automated data analysis. The results were ... inconclusive. Also: VSCods is awesome!

**Thoughts:** Today I was getting a little frustrated that the VSCode installations on my two different workplaces (laptop vs desktop) had different settings, different extensions, and were generally drifting further apart by the day. I spent a little time searching for a half-remembered package I had installed on my laptop over the weekend, and instead discovered the `Sync Settings` extension. (Which, as well as solving my extension issues, also introduced me to the wonderful world of `github` *gists*.) Now both machines are back in sync, and I've got several other cool extensions installed as well.

## Day 48: May 8, 2020: Friday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Refactored, testing improved

**Today's Progress:** The log parsing code was ... convoluted and messy. It needed to be cleaned up, Now it's better, and more easily testable.

## Day 47: May 7, 2020: Thursday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Regexp handling fixed

**Today's Progress:** This was one of those frustrating things where I don't have a decent test suite, so testing only occurs when I run the program.

**Thoughts:** Don't you love a good runtime error? I think I've fixed it -- and also learned about git stash.

## Day 46: May 6, 2020: Wednesday

### Miscellaneous coding project: json files

**Today's Progress:** Analysing semi-related json-formatted file structures, looking for commonalities and differences.

## Day 45: May 5, 2020: Tuesday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 17](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/17-Node.js)

**Today's Progress:** Node.js: just like regular js, but with Nodes. I guess?! (I jest. Kinda.) We also covered bash, which was nothing new.

## Day 44: May 4, 2020: Monday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 14](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/14-The_Simon_Game)

**Today's Progress:** The Simon Game, using jQuery (from Section 13, which I also covered.)

**Thoughts:** Section 13 was `jQuery`. We went through it without doing much, so I decided to convert the Section 12 project to jQuery, and add a little extra: classes.

While developing `Simon`, I struggled a little with jQuery; I think I was confused over how it should be working, or how it could be used.

## Day 43: May 3, 2020: Sunday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 12](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/12-Advanced_JavaScript)

**Today's Progress:** Advanced JavaScript: developed the drum playing website. Covers audio, animation, objects, and DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts:** It occurs to me that I have just learned how to add music to a website.

My first website, lost now to the mists of time, was built in, oh, let's say 1998, give or take. It was an exercise in pre-CSS HTML (3.01, I want to say?) One of the cool things I figured out how to do was to add music that would auto-play on each page.

Shortly thereafter, I spoke to the team who were building one of the `Doom` clones (I think it was `Boom` but I could be wrong.) They were attempting to get music playing on _their_ site, and I was happy to give them the info they needed. For years thereafter, their site played `Doom` music to its visitors, and they gave me the credit, right their on their page. (Sadly, it does not seem to exist any more; it finally got replaced by a wiki, as far as I can tell!)

And shortly after _that_, I was educated as to why auto-playing music was a bad idea, and took my first steps into the world of accessibility--or at least, into acknowledging that not everybody liked what I liked. I turned the music off... (Was that _the night the music died_? Let's not go there.)

I find myself wondering how that person with accessibility issues copes with the web of today, with animations and auto-start video ads everywhere.

Either way, here we are, 22 years later, and I've just learned how to get my website to play music. The words of Ian Malcolm come to mind...

## Day 42: May 2, 2020: Saturday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 11](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/11-The_Dice_Game)

**Today's Progress:** Document Object Model: The good stuff! Finally get to start doing something with JavaScript! Developing a "dice game" as a challenge.

## Day 41: May 1, 2020: Friday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Relocated

**Today's Progress:** Thinking about git branching made me realise TweetCommit belonged inside my 100daysofcode repo.

**Thoughts:** Because TweetCommit is _only_ used for tweeting/committing changes to the `log.md` file in this repository, I decided it _belonged_ here, rather than in a separate repo! The realisation came to me because, after my adventures in git-branching (see yesterday's entry) I wanted to do something a little more than simply commit absolutely everything onto `master`. To do this I needed to modify both `increment-log.py` and `TweetCommit`; they are two halves of the same coin, but lived in separate repositories... That seemed wrong!

I merged my TweetCommit repository into my 100DaysofCode repository (see [here](https://saintgimp.org/2013/01/22/merging-two-git-repositories-into-one-repository-without-losing-file-history/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-on-rebase) for details on how I did this.) I then modified the code as necessary (as I type this I realise I need to make one more change to `TweetCommit`, but I'll confirm that by running it to comit this file!)

## Day 40: April 30, 2020: Thursday

Learning all about branch use (methods and strategies) in git.

## Day 39: April 29, 2020: Wednesday

More of the same. Fixed the problems I had.

## Day 38: April 28, 2020: Tuesday

Once more. Primarily bug fixes, digging through the new codebase to find the two or three subtle bugs that were causing the whole thing to fail.

## Day 37: April 27, 2020: Monday

Another late night. Secret project, etc. Got the new solution from Friday all coded up and integrated.

## Day 36: April 26, 2020: Sunday

Another late night working on my secret project. Had to pull the code apart and put it back together in order to make the next change. Of course, that gave me enough trouble that I was beginning to regret the move (and considering reverting to the earlier version) before I finally figiured out the best way to structure everything.

## Day 35: April 24, 2020: Friday

Watched the first half of `Intro to JavaScript` without learning much; it's all basic discussion around general programming concepts.

I was also up late working on my secret project. Very late. So late that on Saturday I went for a long walk rather than even look at a computer. I actually found the solution to a tricky problem, and was exploring how to make it work.

## Day 34: April 23, 2020: Thursday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 7](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/07-IntermediateBootstrap)

**Today's Progress:** Bootstrap completed; looking forward to getting into JavaScript!

**Thoughts:** The final part of this section involved refactoring, which ... I actually had a few issues with the structure of the HTML itself; I figured the sample site had bigger issues. And I'd been partially refactoring along the way (and using CSS variables, which I love.)

Mostly, though, I think I was keen to get past the section and get my teeth into JavaScript.

I ... working through the last couple of sections have actually given me a few ideas for a personal website I want to work on. I kinda suspect I'll need JS to fully achieve what I have in mind -- not to mention a bit of artistic ability that I don't necessarily have! Torn by new interests: story of my life. I also have new work to do on the project that shall not be named, so there's that.

## Day 33: April 22, 2020: Wednesday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 6](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/06-Intro_to_Bootstrap4)

**Today's Progress:** I think this is the first time I've used a CSS framework. Definitely the first time I've dug deeply.

**Thoughts:** I got so keen I dipped into the next section: **Intermediate Bootstrap**. Will continue with it until bedtime. Interesting stuff ... and basically, I guess your choice of framework depends a lot on what features it has that you want.

ðŸ¤”

Maybe I should look into which other frameworks are available and/or popular!

## Day 32: April 21, 2020: Tuesday

### Confidential Golang Project, Day 4

**Today's Progress:** Finished for now. Plenty more to do, but the proof-of-concept works (rather well, IMHO!)

**Thoughts:** Next up? Make it pretty, change the comms, etc. Plenty more to learn! I think after several variations, various _iterations_, I've come up with the optimal configuration of goroutines and channel communications--until we enter the next phase, anyway.

## Day 31: April 20, 2020: Monday

### Confidential Golang Project, Day 3

**Today's Progress:** After many hours of beating my head against the brick wall of my confusion (and some frenzied doc-writing) I think I know what I'm doing!

**Thoughts:** I guess we'll find out!

## Day 30: April 19, 2020: Sunday

### Confidential Golang Project, Day 2

**Today's Progress:** More of the same -- and basically two 14-hour days! I need sleep.

**Thoughts:** It should work ... but I'll find that out tomorrow morning!

## Day 29: April 18, 2020: Saturday

### Confidential Golang Project, Day 1

**Today's Progress:** Spent a full day banging out Go code: goroutines, channels, all the fun stuff!

**Thoughts:** I can't discuss the details here, but suffice it to say, I am happy with my progress so far, and I've learned a lot about Concurrent programming, something I'd never really tackled before!

Oh yeah, and I also started to look at the **Bootstrap 4** section of the WebDev Bootcamp -- but more on that when I get time!

## Day 28: April 17, 2020: Friday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 4](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/04-Intro_to_CSS) (Part II)

**Today's Progress:** Intermediate CSS. Also played with "Intro to HTML" in FrontEnd Masters' Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** There were reasons I started looking at the FEM Bootcamp today. I'm not convinced that doing so was such a great idea though. I started getting bored--not because of the quality of the course, _per se_, but because it was mostly covering stuff I'd only just covered. I think I shall focus on just the one course at a time from now on.

And next up ... **Bootstrap 4** _WTFisBS4_? I feel like I've heard of it, and I _want_ to dive in--but for the next couple of days I'm actually really busy doing programming work I can't talk about here. I've got a lot to do and not much time to get it done, so I may be skipping a couple of days. We'll see...

## Day 27: April 16, 2020: Thursday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 4](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/04-Intro_to_CSS)

**Today's Progress:** Intro to CSS. CSS is cool. I've loved it since I first discovered it.

**Thoughts:** Is [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/214) still a thing? (Yes. Yes it is. Although it seems a couple of older links are broken...) That site, more than anything, convinced me that CSS was the way to go. If you haven't already, go check it out.

## Day 26: April 15, 2020: Wednesday

### 2020 WebDev BootCamp [Section 3](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/03-Intermediate_HTML)

**Today's Progress:** Intermediate HTML. I am actually learning a few things which have changed since I last played with HTML.

**Thoughts:** For anyone checking out these links, I plan to use **one** github repository for **all** my Udemy tutorial work. I have a number of lessons stacked up that I have just not had time to play with. I guess there's nothing like a global shutdown for freeing up some time! Sadly (\*ahem\*) I am actually busy (as mentioned below) with a project which I _hope_ will turn into an actual paid job sometime soon, so I can't spend all my time on this ... but a section a day seems reasonable!

## Day 25: April 14, 2020: Tuesday

### 2020 Web Development Bootcamp [Section 2](https://github.com/PJSoftware/udemy-2020webdev/tree/master/Sections/02-Intro_to_HTML)

**Today's Progress:** Started at the very beginning: Intro to HTML. Refreshing out-of-date knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I already know a fair bit of HTML and CSS, but I'm a little rusty -- and putting those topics together with all the other topics covered in this course, with a focus on modern technologies (my HTML/CSS knowledge is a few years out of date) made it a no-brainer to pick up on Udemy.

I have also been working on a project I can't really discuss in public, so there's that!

## Day 24: April 13, 2020: Monday

### [CSS Grid Tutorial(s)](https://github.com/PJSoftware/tut-web-cssgrid) Via YouTube

**Today's Progress:** Today I happened across a YouTube tutorial on CSS Grid, and decided to follow along.

**Thoughts:** I already had a vague knowledge of CSS Grid, but this tutorial was well worth working through. I learned about the Grid model, and a few things about `VSCode`!

A second tutorial popped out of YouTube once I had finished the first, and I decided to give it a go too. Sadly, while I definitely learned a few things, I was just not happy with the end results (or, indeed, the design we were attempting to duplicate!)

But hey, yay Grid! (Note: the second tutorial did not use Grid anyway!)

## Day 23: April 12, 2020: Sunday

### [Win-Spotlight](https://github.com/PJSoftware/Win-Spotlight) Added DeleteDuplicate Command

**Today's Progress:** I refactored the codebase for `UpdateSpotlight.exe` so that I could add `DeleteDuplicate.exe` while reusing common code.

**Thoughts:** Because my first version of `UpdateSpotlight` did not have the ability to read the metadata files, I have numerous Spotlight wallpapers which do not match the current naming convention. I decided the best thing to do at the time was to move all the old ones into a subfolder and worry about them later.

Later is now, more or less. `DeleteDuplicates` compares the Spotlight Wallpaper folder with the Spotlight Wallpaper Archive folder and, well, deletes duplicates. The first pass deleted perhaps 8 or 10 duplicated images. Because I maintain the folder in question under SVN, I then added the "SVN-Rename" option so that any new duplicates discovered (which must be due to new incoming images) will be renamed out of archive rather than deleted and created. This is more efficient for SVN to handle.

## Day 22: April 11, 2020: Saturday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Regexp Fixed

**Today's Progress:** Revised the regexp, added testing, refactored the credential code.

**Thoughts:** When you have a regexp which looks like `^[#]{3} [[]([^]]+)[]][(][^)]+[)]\s*(\S.+)?$` in a program which runs once a day and posts its results for the world to see, if you are changing that regexp you kinda want to be able to test the results before you go live. (I know. I should use `/x` to make my regular expressions more readable, but I still have difficulty wrapping my head around how to best format a regexp/x!) I refactored my various regular expressions into a separate function so I could better test them--and sure enough, my revised version was broken. Having the unit test made it much easier to fix the problem and be sure it was working as intended.

I also rewrote/refactored the credential handling code. Linking in my gotokens code was a good thing to do, but the way I'd done it was a little awkward.

## Day 21: April 9, 2020: Thursday

### [pdfill package](https://github.com/PJSoftware/pdfill) Split() Functionality Complete

**Today's Progress:** Split() is now fully working, fully tested (well, 92.6% tested; not sure how to test the internal error code!)

## Day 20: April 8, 2020: Wednesday

### [pdfill package](https://github.com/PJSoftware/pdfill) Bare Bones Edition

**Today's Progress:** Worked on, among other things, a Go interface to the command line of PDFill, a PDF Tools program.

**Thoughts:** I've been a user of PDFill Free PDF Tools for years. Registering the full package gives you access to the command line options--or rather, you have access without registering; registering removes the "PDFill" text it inserts when using the command line tools with the free version!

I bought the full version of PDFill years ago, because I needed the ability to automate merging multiple PDFs into one. Back then I wrote a simple `Perl` library to give me that capability. Now, I need the ability to split PDFs into their individual pages; rather than extend the existing code I've decided to do it in `Go`, because:

- Well, why not?
- It's what I'm focussing on at the moment.
- I really need to create a compiled executable.

The full program I'm working on is _hopefully_ for work--as in, I may end up getting a job out of this--so I won't be making it public, but the `pdfill` package itself will be quite straightforward; anybody who wants to go and register the (excellent) [PDFill Editor](https://www.pdfill.com/) and read their command line options page would be able to cobble together something similar.

Currently it's very bare-bones, but I'm building in testing as I go. Attempting to, anyway. I'll probably never cover the full range of PDFill commands available ... but I'll see how I go.

## Day 19: April 7, 2020: Tuesday

### [gotokens package](https://github.com/PJSoftware/gotokens) Preliminary version

**Today's Progress:** Developed my first github-hosted standalone Go package, for use with TweetCommit (among others.)

**Thoughts:** This was quite a heavy day, full of steep learning curves. Among my achievements:

- Relocated the development of the package to the relevant path (`src/github.com/pjsoftware`) of my `$GOPATH` folder. Up until now I've been working elsewhere because, well, because I come from a non-Go, non-git, primarily Windows background, and all of my development until recently has been within my SVN working folder tree. When I fully embraced the beauty (and horror) of `git` on the command line (for a while I was using `svn` to keep my `github` repository up to date; it works, but it is definitely _sub-optimal_!) I created myself a git working folder! (Hey, if it works...!)
- Developed a standalone package intended to be sourced via github. No doubt there are things missing--a _licence_, for instance--but I figured it was time to work out how to make this work, and the best way to learn is to do. One of the big decisions I had to make was what to call the repository. While I'm currently focussing heavily on `Go`, I _will_ be playing with other languages too, so I ultimately opted for the 'go' prefix to the name. My first impulse was to do something like 'gopackages/tokens', but it seems `git` does not really handle (or allow) subrepositories such as I would have used with `svn`. (Comparing the two, `git` has both advantages and disadvantages vs `svn`!)
- Built a full error handling system within the package. Back on **Day 13** I made a preliminary foray into the wonders of extended error handling in `Go`. However, I was tacking it onto existing code, so it was a shoddy attempt at best--and I just did not _grok_ it. Having built it in from the ground up, I think I have a much better idea of what it can do, and how to use it properly.
- Full unit testing was not only added after the fact, but built alongside my code from the ground up. This helped me find a few errors which I would otherwise never have detected until tomorrow--or, y'know, months down the road.
- I gained a huge appreciation for just how productive `VSCode` can be when developing and, specifically, testing `Go` code. I'd already discovered how much better a modern `IDE` could be than the old, simple syntax-highlighting editor I had been using for so long. Full code completion, syntax error detection, all those awesome things are great--and `Go` even specifies the formatting to use, so having it reformat your code as you go just eliminates the old formatting arguments/decisions. (They never really affected me when I was happily working in isolation, but I was always aware of them.) **Also**, when running your package tests from inside the editor, `VSCode` not only tells you the percentage of code coverage you have achieved, it also highlights the code that has and has not actually been tested! Invaluable!

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Revised to use gotokens

## Day 18: April 6, 2020: Monday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 10

**Today's Progress:** Refactored my first three solvers, and my cell collection code.

**Thoughts:** I actually got quite a bit done, without making any actual progress! Because I _know_ that the fourth solver is going to be complicated to write, I decided, first off, to split each solver into its own `.go` file. In the process of doing this, I discovered that I no longer remembered how `solver03` works, and the code did _not_ clarify anything. Because it now lived in its own file, it was much easier to refactor it in an attempt to make the code more readable.

This, of course, led to the solver breaking! I added a bunch of debugging print statements using the existing `showWorking` mechanism, and discovered that during the refactoring process I had managed to drop an important `else`. I fixed that up, and then decided that it made more sense for my `s3` to have its own independent `showWorking` code. More importantly, this then set the precedent for `s4` to be a lot more organised and easy to keep track of what I'm doing as I write it.

The entire process took longer than it should have, and involved a great wailing and gnashing of teeth, but it had the important result that my solver code, which was rapidly becoming cumbersome and monolithic, is now a lot more flexible, and as I move forward with more solvers, this will allow me a lot more flexibility to do whatever I need to achieve the required result.

Finally--or rather, initially, because it was one of the first things I did--I moved the `cellCollections` back into the `Grid` struct (where they originally existed before I broke them out!) I am pretty sure that in order to write `solver04` I will need to create duplicates of the current state of the data, and this will be easier if I just need to copy the Grid and don't have to also juggle independent collections.

## Day 17: April 5, 2020: Sunday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Code Structure Refined

**Today's Progress:** Made the code more oop-oriented.

**Thoughts:** This was mostly a reorganisation of code to allow all the possible errors to be triggered _before_ any non-reversible action has occurred. Making the `tweeter` package OO allowed me to easily split the init code from the tweeting code.

At the same time I moved the `main.go` file into a `cmd/TweetCommit` folder (as per yesterday's `Win-Spotlight` update) and added a `publish.sh` shell script to simplify building the `exe` file and copying it out to where it is needed. (Possibly a symlink would make more sense ... but we _are_ still working on a Windows machine, even if we're currently using `git bash` to get around. A shortcut, maybe? I'll do some testing...)

## Day 16: April 4, 2020: Saturday

### [Win-Spotlight](https://github.com/PJSoftware/Win-Spotlight) Converted to Module

**Today's Progress:** Still trying to wrap my head around the benefits of `Go` modules.

**Thoughts:** It does seem to make my pathing work a little better--by forcing me to use the github paths to everything. Since I'm also trying to wrap my head around how best to use github to host `Go` packages, this seems to be a step in the right direction.

At the same time, I was wrestling with the fact that `go build` was, by default, creating a `Win-Spotlight.exe` file rather than the preferred `UpdateSpotlight.exe`. I could probably have renamed the repository to fix this, but I opted, instead, to use a `cmd/UpdateSpotlight` folder. This means I now have to `cd` into that folder to build my code, but maybe I'll add a `build.sh` to the parent folder to get around that.

## Day 15: April 3, 2020: Friday

### [Log Incrementer increment-log.py](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/blob/master/increment-log.py) Update 2

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the formatting of the date

**Thoughts:** While making my last tweak of `increment-log.py`, I spent a little time looking for a formatting code to use with `strftime` which would _not_ zero-pad the day of the month. I found something online which told me I could use `%-d` instead of `%d`. Turns out this was not correct--and because that particular line of code is only interpreted at runtime, I would not find out until I tried to run the script today.

To get the format I actually wanted, I had to specifically check for the leading zero and remove it.

To ensure this does not happen again--well, I guess it's time to look into unit testing in Python!

## Day 14: April 2, 2020: Thursday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Output Revised

**Today's Progress:** Revised output to better explain what is happening.

**Thoughts:** `TweetCommit.exe` is working okay, but it needs a little refinement. It actually _seems_ to hang for a while, so I've added output to give a better idea of what is going on. (I _think_ I know where the delay is happening, but until I run it with the new output enabled I really don't know for sure!)

**Update:** `git push` is where the biggest delay lies...

### `increment-log.py` Revised

**Thoughts:** I thought there was something in my code which detected an attempt to add a date in the future to the `log.md` file, but apparently there was not.

Now there is:

```python
    if date > date.today():
        print("Increment cancelled; new date would be in the future!")
        return
```

## Day 13: April 1, 2020: Wednesday

### [Win-Spotlight](https://github.com/PJSoftware/Win-Spotlight) Revisited

**Lost Time:** Okay, so I missed a few days between my last coding attempt and now. In that time I watched plenty of NetFlix and did zero coding. (You guys: `#TheOA` is amazing! Check it out!)

**Today's Progress:** Made a quick fix to file naming; added tests and error handling.

#### Wallpaper Naming

`Win-Spotlight` is one of the first things I wrote in Go. It looks for new `Spotlight` images (delivered on the regular by Windows 10) and copies them out of their delivery folder into a specified wallpaper folder. This gave me the opportunity to play with `INI` and `JSON` files in `Go` -- not to mention exploring working with `UTF16`. Plus it gives me a folder full of awesome wallpapers to use on my machine.

It also confirmed, once and for all, that I had to move away from using the old text editor I've been using for the last 18-odd years -- and, honestly, much as I loved it, that has been the best thing I could have done!

I noticed that, despite my efforts to intercept it in the renaming process, some of the files in my wallpaper folder had a doubled-up copyright symbol in their name. I renamed them there, but obviously the only way to truly fix the problem is by curing the illness rather than treating the symptoms. _(Signs that you are living through the **Coronapocalypse**: medical analogies in your log files!)_ So my first work for today was to fix up that particular piece of code.

#### Unit Tests

**The Plan:**

So, did my fix actually do what I think it does? How would I know?

As somebody who is mostly self-taught, and who has done most of their coding in isolation\*, I only picked up the concept of `TDD` (Test Driven Development) a couple of years ago. Great idea, loved it, and promptly started applying it (no doubt naively) to my `Perl` programming. It's probably time to work on doing the same in my ongoing `Go` work!

I probably won't write a completely comprehensive test suite today, but I'd at least like to get enough done that I can confirm my new code works as intended.

\* This has shaped much of my approach to coding (obviously) and it will probably come up again!

**Achieved:** I added one unit test for `newFilename()` to ensure that our output is as expected. This enabled me to rewrite the function to be more efficient, and to put all our intended regexp transformations in a table. (I originally coded it as a `map`, but the order of transforms was important to the end result, so I redefined it as a `slice` of `struct`s.)

#### Error Handling

**The Plan:**

As somebody who is mostly self-taught, and who has done most of their coding in isolation\*, my approach to error handling in other languages has been ... minimal. A few years back I ran across the concept of throwing exceptions and letting the calling code catch them if necessary. Plenty of this started creeping into my `Perl` code from that point on.

Of course, `Go` takes error handling in the complete opposite direction, treating errors as values which can be passed back to the calling code, there to be checked or ignored as required -- with the caveat that ignoring them _must_ be a deliberate choice rather than a simple oversight. In many ways this is the same logic as throwing an exception: the programmer can choose to either deal with it or ignore it, but they _must_ choose. I like it. Even if it does tend to clutter the code...

During my _lost-time_ hiatus (I'm just gonna go ahead and blame alien abduction!) I actually did a little reading on error handling in Go. It's something I'll be exploring further, but certainly adding an `Error` type in this code (if I have the time) would be a good start.

\* Told you!

**Achieved:** I fiddled around a bit with an `errors` sub-package, and applied it (very simply) in a few places. At the moment I'm simply lifting it from various online locations; I need to do more thinking about how best to implement it for this application (and/or any other.)

## Day 12: March 26, 2020: Thursday

### [TweetCommit (was AutoTweeter)](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Final Tweak

**Today's Progress:** Renamed. Added code to prevent tweeting the same entry more than once.

**Thoughts:** So ... `increment-log.py` has safeguards to prevent it from incrementing the log when there are uncommitted changes, or when it only contains the stub from the previous run. And `TweetCommit.exe` has safeguards to prevent it from doing anything when the log has not yet been filled in. But as far as I can tell, if I happen to run it twice in a row, there is nothing to stop it from tweeting out the same tweet it has already sent. Which is, I guess, not actually _wrong_, but it _is_ a little spammy.

I guess the best way to achieve that would be to check whether git considers the `log.md` file clean or not. We have already done this in `Python` with:

```python
    gs = subprocess.run(['git', 'diff-index', 'master', 'log.md'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    if gs.stdout != b'':
        print("log.md has uncommitted changes; ignoring")
        return
```

The question is, how do we do this in `Go`? Presumably the same way: run `git diff-index` and interpret the result. Time to do a little more reading around the `exec` library, I guess.

**Solution:**

```go
    out, err := exec.Command("git", "diff-index", "HEAD", fn).Output()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    str := string(out)

    if str == "" { // no changes
        return true
    }

```

## Day 11: March 25, 2020: Wednesday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Day 2

**Today's Progress:** TweetCommit completed; now commits AND tweets

**Thoughts:** Of course, until I run my script I won't actually know if it works as intended. That's the joy of code which tweets and/or commits: you don't want to be test-running it a thousand times on potentially live systems.

**Update:** It works!

## Day 10: March 24, 2020: Tuesday

### [TweetCommit](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/tree/master/TweetCommit) Day 1

**Today's Progress:** Preliminary work on TweetCommit

**Thoughts:** This code is adapted from [TutorialEdge.net](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/writing-a-twitter-bot-golang/) and uses a couple of external libraries. Ultimately I think I'd like to tackle writing something from scratch, but for now I just wanted something that worked.

The **TutorialEdge** code worked by setting your API user tokens as part of your environment--because as author **Elliot Forbes** rightly says, information like that should not be committed to your repository. Since I work on two different home machines at the moment--a desktop and a laptop--I opted instead to save my API tokens in a json file on my home network so that both computers can access them easily.

Tweeting via this code does actually work, but that is only part of what I want it to do. The second step would be for it to read and parse _this_ log file, pull out the most recent Day number, project name, and "Today's Progress" blurb, and construct a tweet from those. However, it should _also_ commit (and push) this file to github using the same information. Possibly "AutoTweet" is a bit of a misnomer, and the repo name may change at some point. (Done.)

**Things to Investigate Further:** Go Modules. Also, how best to publish individual Go packages to github so I can use them in multiple projects if required.

## Day 9: March 23, 2020: Monday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 9

**Today's Progress:** Added '-all' option

**Thoughts:** The '-all' option directs the solver to attempt to solve all puzzles contained in the 'puzzles' folder. Summaries of the results will be displayed. This provides an easier way to test the latest solvers on all available puzzles.

Having looked at the final state of the two puzzles which cannot currently be solved, it seems that the planned fourth solver will not be able to make much progress on one of them ("expert.sp") and therefore, perhaps I need to revise my intended approach somewhat.

I may need to start actually researching advanced solving techniques.

## Day 8: March 22, 2020: Sunday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 8

**Today's Progress:** Added third solver

**Thoughts:** The code for this one is a little ... messy. I feel it could probably be refactored quite a bit, and that will probably happen when I add the next solver, because I feel they'll both be using similar code. Adding this solver allowed us to solve our "hard" puzzle.

## Day 7: March 21, 2020: Saturday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 7

**Today's Progress:** Added another solver.

**Thoughts:** The second solving method is to examine each block and, for each value that is not already used, examine all empty squares to determine if any of them only have one possible location. To simplify the code calling each solution in turn, I built a function table; all future solutions simply need to be added to the table in order to be processed.

The new code solves at least one of the puzzles in my meagre repertoire which was previously unsolvable, so I guess that's progress.

Next step: work on solving the remaining cells of the unsolvable puzzles, determine my next strategy, and codify it.

## Day 6: March 20, 2020: Friday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 6

**Today's Progress:** Added ShowWorking and OPV support

**Thoughts:** I actually did not do any of this coding until Saturday morning, but I did a lot of thinking about it on Friday, so it counts. (I'll be doing more coding on Saturday too!)

First, I refined the display of the grid to improve readability.

Second, I added the ability for my solvers to optionally show their working. At the same time I clarified the "OnePossibleValue" approach which my only actual solver func uses. This became necessary because I had added a couple more "easy"/"medium" puzzles (from a magazine Mum had, while I was at her place on Thursday night) which I _expected_ my solver to handle, but which it could not touch. It did not make sense, because from a quick visual inspection I could easily fill in a couple of values. Something was going wrong, and I needed to figure out what.

Turns out what was going on was that my code was working perfectly as intended. It was my brain that was glitching; the method I was using to get started on the new puzzles was not simply "OnePossibleValue"; I was actually visually identifying narrow points in individual blocks and then eliminating possible values for surrounding cells. It was just so automatic that I thought I was doing OPV processing.

Did I just debug my brain?

Now I need to analyse what I was actually doing by eye, and convert that back into code. But that's a task for tomorrow\*.

_\* Later today!_

## Day 5: March 19, 2020: Thursday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 5

**Today's Progress:** Rewrote the code. It now works -- although it cannot solve more difficult puzzles.

**Thoughts:** While pulling the code apart so I could clean up some of the unnecessary complications, I noticed a loop around a block of code which did not actually make sense. That may not have been the cause of the bug, but it certainly wasn't helping. The new version is cleaner, and it works.

The next step will be to figure out how to solve more complex puzzles.

## Day 4: March 18, 2020: Wednesday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 4

**Today's Progress:** Zero!

**Thoughts:** I've spent some time adding print statements and attempting to decipher what I'm seeing. It seems as though, for each set of cellCollection objects, only the final cell is being updated. I have arrays of arrays of pointers to arrays of pointers -- and I think somewhere in there, my understanding of how things work does not match with reality.

More, smarter debugging and/or testing is required.

### Log Incrementer [increment-log.py](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/blob/master/increment-log.py) Update 1

**Today's Progress:** Added detection of git status of log.md; will not add a new day's entry until previous changes have been committed.

**Thoughts:** Now that this is in place, we no longer need the somewhat clumsy method of making our new "##" an "###" to allow detection that way. Both approaches achieve the same end result: preventing us from inadvertently running the script multiple times between edits. Also, added an enum.

## Day 3: March 17, 2020: Tuesday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 3

**Today's Progress:** The First Pass solver technically should be working, but I appear to have a bug in the code which updates the cell possible values.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure quite what the problem is, but some of my "possible cell value" data is not being set properly. I need to dig into it a little deeper. Looks like Day 4 will be primarily a debugging session.

## Day 2: March 16, 2020: Monday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 2

**Today's Progress:** Revised code structure. Import() and Display() now working as intended.

**Thoughts:** As well as the overhaul of the Sudoku Grid internals, I ran into a little confusion over whether my grid was numbered 1-9 x 1-9, or 0-8 x 0-8. Internally, of course, the array index is zero-based, but in my head I'd been thinking one-based, and converting where required. I think this is because the valid values are 1-9. At some point during today's coding I started using zero-based loops, and when the two systems clashed, I ultimately set up the gridCoord array, so I could use "for xi, xn := range gridCoord" and use either xi or xn as required. Ultimately, this revealed to me that I really only require zero-based numbering of rows and columns!

**Note**: I decided that keeping this log in reverse order (most recent day first) actually makes it easier to read. YMMV (and I may yet change my mind; it's known to happen!) I'm also thinking that very soon now I shall write a script or somthing to automate inserting the new day's date and template...

### Log Incrementer [increment-log.py](https://github.com/PJSoftware/100-days-of-code/blob/master/increment-log.py)

**Today's Progress:** Added **increment-log.py** to this repository.

**Thoughts:** I wanted a script to automate adding a new day to our **log.md** file. It would have been a matter of moments to write this in Perl--so I opted to write it in Python instead. I am still at the "google every line of code" stage with Python, so it took a little longer. Additionally, much as I wanted to use this script straight away, it was really done during Day 2, so rather than throw myself out of sync, I've relocated it here so Day 3 can proceed as intended...

## Day 1: March 15, 2020: Sunday

### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/PJSoftware/sudoku-solver) Day 1

**Today's Progress:** I worked out the basic code structure and added the basic ability to import a puzzle from an external file. The code appears to compile and run at this point, although I really need to add some tests.

**Thoughts:** I feel like this was a good start.
