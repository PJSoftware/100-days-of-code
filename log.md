# Pete's Log: 100 Days Of Code Challenge (Round 1)

## Day 1: March 15, 2020: Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I worked out the basic code structure and added the basic ability to import a puzzle from an external file. The code appears to compile and run at this point, although I really need to add some tests.

**Thoughts:** I feel like this was a good start.
